Note that every colouring $\alpha = (\alpha_j)_{j=0}^\infty: Z \to A$ generates an element $\B_\alpha = (\B_{\alpha_j})_{j=0}^k$ of $\Col(Z)$, where $\B_{\alpha_j}$ is the $\sigma$-algebra of $Z_j$ is generated by the level sets of $\alpha_j: Z_j \to A_j$.

witness subdags,"For a permutation $\pi_k$, a \emph{witness subdag for $\pi_k$} is defined to be a directed acyclic simple graph, whose nodes are labeled with pairs of the form $(x,y)$. If a node $v$ is labeled by $(x,y)$, we write $v \approx (x,y)$. This graph must in addition satisfy the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If any pair of nodes overlaps in a coordinate, that is, we have $v \approx (x,y) \sim (x', y') \approx v'$, then nodes $v, v'$ must be comparable (that is, either there is a path from $v$ to $v'$ or vice-versa). 
\item Every node of $G$ has in-degree at most two and out-degree at most two.

Projection of a witness tree,"For a witness tree $\tau$, we define the \emph{projection of $\tau$ onto permutation $\pi_k$} which we denote $\text{Proj}_k(\tau)$, as follows.

Suppose we have a node $v \in \tau$ which is labeled by some bad-event $B = (k_1, x_1, y_1), \dots, (k_r, x_r, y_r)$. For each $i$ with $k_i = k$, we create a corresponding node $v'_i \approx (x_i, y_i)$ in the graph $\text{Proj}_k(\tau)$. We also include some auxiliary information indicating that these nodes came from bad event $B$, and in particular that all such nodes are part of the same bad-event.

The edges of $\text{Proj}_k(\tau)$ are formed follows. For each node $v' \in \text{Proj}_k(\tau)$, labeled by $(x,y)$ and corresponding to $v \in \tau$, we find the node $w_x \in \tau$ (if any) which satisfies the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(P1)] The depth of $w_x$ is smaller than the depth of $v$
\item[(P2)] $w_x$ is labeled by some bad-event $B'$ which contains $(k,x, *)$
\item[(P3)] Among all vertices satisfying (P1), (P2), the depth of $w_x$ is maximial
\end{enumerate}

If this node $w_x \in \tau$ exists, then it corresponds to a node $w_x' \in \text{Proj}_k(\tau)$ labeled $(k, x, *)$; we construct an edge from $v'$ to $w_x'$. Note that, since the levels of the witness tree are independent under $\sim$, there can be at most one such $w_x$ and at most one such $w_x'$.

We similary define a node $w_y$ satisfying:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(P1')] The depth of $w_y$ is smaller than the depth of $v$
\item[(P2')] $w_y$ is labeled by some bad-event $B'$ which contains $(k,y, *)$
\item[(P3')] Among all vertices satisfying (P1), (P2), the depth of $w_y$ is maximial
\end{enumerate}
If this node exists, we create an edge from $v'$ to the corresponding $w_y' \in \text{Proj}_k(\tau)$ labeled $(k,*,y)$.

Note that since edges in $\text{Proj}_k(\tau)$ correspond to \emph{strictly} smaller depth in $\tau$, the graph $\text{Proj}_k (\tau)$ is acyclic. Also, note that it is possible that $w_x = w_y$; in this case we only add a single edge to $\text{Proj}_k(\tau)$.

\textbf{Expository Remark:} In the special case when each bad-event contains a single element, the witness subdag is a ``flattening"" of the tree structure.

\rm Up-down Markov chains,"\label{2.3}
Let $\mathcal M$ be a Markov measure on $\mathcal T$ and $\{M^{(n)}\}$ be the

that the transition probabilities $p^\up=\{p^\up(\la,\nu)\}$ and
$p^\down=\{p^\down(\la,\mu\}$ are well defined for all edges of the Young
graph.

For each $n=1,2,\dots$, we define a Markov chain with the state space $\Y_n$ in
the following way. Given a diagram $\la\in\Y_n$ we apply first the up
transition probabilities $p^\up(\la,\nu)$ and get a random diagram
$\nu\in\Y_{n+1}$. Then we come back to $\Y_n$ by using the down transition
probabilities $p^\down(\nu,\kappa)$. The composition $\la\to\nu\to\kappa$
constitutes a single step of the chain.

In other words, for two diagrams $\la,\kappa\in\Y_n$, the probability of the
one-step transition $\la\to\kappa$ is equal to
\begin{equation}\label{tag2.4}
\Prob\{\la\to\kappa\}=\sum_{\nu:\,

As can easily be seen, the set of faces $\LL(C)$ contains $2k$ faces: $k$ points and  $k$ sections of the curve that are bounded by the points. Let $p_1'$ be a point to the left of $p_1$ which is infinitesimally close to $p_1$ (see Figure \ref{LRBconic}(a)), and let $C_1 = C -\{p_1'\}$. $C_1$ is topologically equivalent to an open segment $S = (a_1',a_1'')$, that is, there exists a distance-preserving homeomorphism $f : C_1  \rightarrow S$, such that $f(p_1') = a_1' = a_1''$. Denote $f(p_i) = a_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq k$.

Explicitly, we think of $C_1$ as a straight segment that starts at the point $a_1'$, when the section that starts
at $a_k$  ends at a  point $a_1''$, which, on $C_1$, is identified with $p_1'$ (see Figure \ref{LRBconic}(b)).

On the pointed segment $S \cup \{a_1,\ldots,a_k\}$, the set of faces consists of $2k+1$ faces. However, on $C$, the segments $f^{-1}(a_1',a_1)$ and $f^{-1}(a_k,a_1'')$ are contained in the same face. As $a_1 - a_1' =\varepsilon \ll 1$, we ignore this infinitesimally-small face and thus $\LL(S)$, the set of faces of $S$, has only $2k$ faces: $k$ points and $k$ open sections of the curve. We now identify this set of faces with the set of faces $\LL(C)$.

We can now associate an LRB structure to $\LL(S)$, as it is done for a set of faces of a pointed line; that is, to every face  $P \in \LL(S)$, we associate a vector of signs $i_H(P) \in (L^1_2)^k$ in the following way: Given $1 < j \leq k$, the  point $a_j$ divides  $S$ into three distinct parts: the point itself $\{x = a_j\}$ and two other open sets: $H_{j,1} = \{x > a_j\}$ and $H_{j,2} = \{x < a_j\}$.

Associate to the set $H_{1,1}$ the sign $+$ (or $-$) and to the set $\{x = a_1\}$ the sign $0$. Again, once we associated these signs for each set, they are fixed  (see Figure \ref{LRBconic}(c)).

relations $<_1$ and $<_2$, and also preserves $w$.

\emph{Grounding conditions for plane tropical curves},"Let $h:C\to\R^2$ be a plane tropical curve of degree~$d$ and

A \emph{ground elevator} of~$h$ % or an \emph{elevator to the ground}

"\emph{%$(\lambda,\rho)$-marked 
Floor diagrams marked by pairs of partitions}","Let $\Dcal$ be a labeled floor diagram of degree~$d$ and genus~$g$. 
Let $\lambda$ and $\rho$ be two partitions with $|\lambda|+|\rho|=d$.
A~$(\lambda,\rho)$-marking of~$\Dcal$ is a combinatorial decoration
of~$\Dcal$ obtained by the following modification of the procedure
used in Definition~\ref{def-marking}. 
We will illustrate the steps of this procedure using a running
example, in which $d=4$, $g=1$, $\lambda=(2)$, $\rho=(1,1)$,
and $\Dcal$ is the labeled floor diagram from

\textbf{Step~1.}
For each original vertex $v$ in~$\Dcal$, introduce some number (possibly none)
of additional new vertices, and connect $v$ to each of them 
by a single edge directed away from~$v$.
In addition, introduce some (possibly none) edges directed from $v$
to $v_1,\dots,v_{\ell(\lambda)}$. 
Assign positive integer weights to all these new edges, so that
\begin{itemize}
\item
for each original vertex $v$ in~$\Dcal$, 
the total weight of all new edges (of both kinds) originating
at~$v$ is equal to $1-\divv(v)$;
\item
the weights of all edges arriving at $v_1,\dots,v_{\ell(\lambda)}$

form the partition~$\lambda$; 
\item
the weights of all other new edges form the partition~$\rho$.

Suppose we have already defined such bijections for labeled floor
diagrams of genus~$0$ and any degree~$<d$.
Now, for a diagram $\Dcal$ of degree~$d$, do the following.
Decompose $\Dcal$ into the root vertex~$d$ and
subdiagrams~$\Dcal_1,\dots,\Dcal_k$ on vertex sets $S_1,\dots,S_k$, as
described in the proof of Theorem~\ref{th:cayley} above.
Let $T_1,\dots,T_k$ denote the trees on vertex sets $S_1,\dots,S_k$
that correspond to $\Dcal_1,\dots,\Dcal_k$, respectively,
under the appropriate bijections.
The tree~$T$ associated to~$\Dcal$ under the bijection in question is
constructed by connecting each tree $T_i$ to the root vertex~$d$ by a single
edge $e'$ that is going to be determined by the unique weighted edge
$v\stackrel{e}{\longrightarrow}d$
connecting $\Dcal_i$ to~$d$ in~$\Dcal$.
It remains to describe the rule that determines~$e'$ from~$e$.
We have already checked (see~\eqref{eq:1-div}) that the total number
of choices for~$e$ is equal to~$|S_i|$.
Let us record those choices in an ordered list as the vertex~$v$ moves left
to right within~$\Dcal_i$; for a given~$v$, we record the choices
starting with the \emph{largest} possible weight value $w(e)=1-\divv_i(v)$ and
decreasing it until we reach the smallest possible weight value

The discrete cube and its faces,"\label{faces}
Let  $\2^k$ denote  the set $\{-1,1\}^k$, which we equip with the lexicographic order.  One can identify $\2^k$ with the vertices of the 
standard cube ${\bf I}^k := \{(x_1,\ldots,x_k) \in \R^k: -1 \leq x_i \leq 1\}$. Under this identification we will refer to $\2^k$ as the standard {\em discrete}

We will  refer to $\beta_j^+, \beta_j^-$ as \emph{opposite sides} or \emph{parallel sides} of $\2^k$, and to the $\beta_j^+$ as the {\em positive sides}. 

More generally, for any $0 \leq l \leq k$, define an \emph{$l$-dimensional face} or \emph{$l$-face} to be any set formed by intersecting $k-l$ distinct non-parallel sides. Thus $\2^k$ has one $k$-face, $2k$ faces of dimension $k-1$ (i.e. the sides $\beta_j^{\pm}$), $k2^{k-l}$ faces of dimension $(k-l)$, and so forth down to $2^k$ faces of dimension $0$ (which are the vertices of the discrete cube).

Commutators and weights,"We define \emph{(formal) commutators} in the letters $x_1,\ldots,x_r$ recursively by defining each $x_i$ to be a formal commutator and, given two formal commutators $\alpha,\alpha'$ in the $x_j$, defining $[\alpha,\alpha']$ also to be a formal commutator.

To each commutator $\alpha$ we assign a \emph{weight vector} $\chi(\alpha)\in\N_0^r$, defined recursively by setting $\chi(x_i):=e_i$ and, given two formal commutators $\alpha,\alpha'$ in the $x_j$, defining $\chi([\alpha,\alpha'])=\chi(\alpha)+\chi(\alpha')$. We define the \emph{total weight} $|\chi(\alpha)|$ of a commutator $\alpha$ to be $\|\chi(\alpha)\|_1$. Given a weight vector $\chi\in\N_0^r$ and a vector $L=(L_1,\ldots,L_r)$ of positive integers we write $L^\chi$ to denote the quantity $L_1^{\chi_1}\cdots L_r^{\chi_r}$.

The collecting process {\cite[\S11.1,"{hall}}]
Let $a:=a_1\cdots a_n$ be a string of commutators, and their inverses, involving elements $x_1,\ldots,x_r$ of an $s$-step nilpotent group. We say that $a$ is in \emph{collected form} if $a_1\prec\ldots\prec a_n$. For $m\in[0,n]$ we say that $a$ has \emph{collected part} $a_1\cdots a_m$ if $a_1\prec\ldots\prec a_m$ and $a_m\prec a_i$ for $i>m$ but $a_{m+1}\succ a_j$ for some $j>m+1$. The string $a_{m+1}\cdots a_n$ is called the \emph{uncollected part} of $a$.

We define a \emph{collecting operator} $\mathcal{C}$ on the set of strings of commutators as follows. If $a$ is in collected form then we simply define $\mathcal{C}(a):=a$. If $a$ is not in collected form then write $\beta$ for the commutator earliest with respect to the order $\prec$ such that $\beta^{\pm1}$ appears in the uncollected part of $a$, and suppose that $a_j$ is the leftmost of the $a_i$ in the uncollected part that is equal to $\beta^{\pm1}$. Write $\alpha$ for the commutator satisfying $a_{j-1}=\alpha^{\pm1}$, and define $\alpha_1:=[\alpha,\beta]$ and $\alpha_{i+1}:=[\alpha_i,\beta]$ for $i=2,\ldots,s-1$. Define $\alpha_i$ to be trivial for $i\ge s$.

If $a_j=\beta$ and $a_{j-1}=\alpha$ then
\[
\mathcal{C}(a):=a_1\cdots a_{j-2}\beta\alpha[\alpha,\beta]a_{j+1}\cdots a_n,
\]
and we say that $\mathcal{C}$ performs a \emph{transformation of type 1} on $a$. If $a_j=\beta$ and $a_{j-1}=\alpha^{-1}$ then
\[
\mathcal{C}(a):=a_1\cdots a_{j-2}\beta[\alpha,\beta]^{-1}\alpha^{-1}a_{j+1}\cdots a_n,
\]
and we say that $\mathcal{C}$ performs a \emph{transformation of type 2} on $a$. If $a_j=\beta^{-1}$ and $a_{j-1}=\alpha$ then
\[
\mathcal{C}(a):=a_1\cdots a_{j-2}\beta^{-1}\alpha\alpha_2\alpha_4\cdots\alpha_5^{-1}\alpha_3^{-1}\alpha_1^{-1}a_{j+1}\cdots a_n,
\]
and we say that $\mathcal{C}$ performs a \emph{transformation of type 3} on $a$. If $a_j=\beta^{-1}$ and $a_{j-1}=\alpha^{-1}$ then
\[
\mathcal{C}(a):=a_1\cdots a_{j-2}\beta^{-1}\alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_5\cdots\alpha_4^{-1}\alpha_2^{-1}\alpha^{-1}a_{j+1}\cdots a_n,
\]
and we say that $\mathcal{C}$ performs a \emph{transformation of type 4} on $a$. The collecting process is then the sequence $a,\mathcal{C}(a),\mathcal{C}^2(a),\ldots$.

Finally, we will often talk about the set of \emph{copies} of a commutator in the collecting process. Each $a_i$ in the original string $a$ is said to be a copy of the commutator $\gamma$ if $a_i=\gamma$, or a copy of $\gamma^{-1}$ if $a_i=\gamma^{-1}$. The collecting operator $\mathcal{C}$ is then thought of as permuting the existing copies of the commutators and of creating a new copy of $[\alpha,\beta]$ in the case of a transformation of type 1; a new copy of $[\alpha,\beta]^{-1}$ in the case of a transformation of type 2; new copies of $\alpha_2,\alpha_4\ldots$ and $\alpha_1^{-1}\alpha_3^{-1}\ldots$ in the case of a transformation of type 3; and new copies of $\alpha_1,\alpha_3\ldots$ and $\alpha_2^{-1}\alpha_4^{-1}\ldots$ in the case of a transformation of type 4.",/home/shufan/que_tex/1211.3989.tex,definition[],"hall]

We refer to $m$ as the \emph{dimension} of the factor, $D_1,\ldots,D_m$ as the \emph{initial degrees} , and $J_1,\ldots,J_m$ as the \emph{depths} .

	%We start with a uniformly randomly chosen generalised spider $R_0$ with length vector $(\ell_1-\gamma_{1,0},\dots,\ell_s-\gamma_{s,0})$. If $R_0$ is $(\ell_1,\dots,\ell_s,\alpha_0)$-weak for $\alpha_0=\frac{1}{L^2}$, then we terminate the process. Otherwise, we extend $R_0$ uniformly randomly to an $L$-bad spider $S_1$ with length vector $(\ell_1,\dots,\ell_s)$. We then take a uniformly random $L$-bad spider among those with length vector $(\ell_1,\dots,\ell_s)$ and the same leaf vector as $S_1$. We call this spider $T_1$. Then we set $R_1$ to be the subspider of $T_1$ with length vector $(\ell_1-\gamma_{1,1},\dots,\ell_s-\gamma_{s,1})$. More generally, for any $1\leq j\leq k$, given a generalised spider $R_{j-1}$ with length vector $(\ell_1-\gamma_{1,j-1},\dots,\ell_s-\gamma_{s,j-1})$, we terminate the process if $R_{j-1}$ is $(\ell_1,\dots,\ell_s,\alpha_{j-1})$-weak for $\alpha_{j-1}=\frac{1}{L^{2^{j}}}$. Otherwise, we let $S_{j}$ be a uniformly random extension of $R_{j-1}$ to an $L$-bad spider with length vector $(\ell_1,\dots,\ell_s)$, let $T_j$ be a uniformly randomly chosen $L$-bad spider with the same length vector and leaf vector as $S_j$, and let $R_j$ be the subspider of $S_j$ with length vector $(\ell_1-\gamma_{1,j},\dots,\ell_s-\gamma_{s,j})$.

%\item the total number of loops connected to the white vertices is equal to the number of loops connected to the black ones,

Dynamic integer flow,"\label{def:dynflows}
Given a signed graph $G$ and an edge $e=(i,j,+)$ of $G$, we will regard $e=(i,j,+)$ as two positive {\em half-edges} $(i,\varnothing,+)$ and $(\varnothing,j,+)$ that still have ``memory'' of being together (see Figure \ref{fig:dynflow} (a)). We assign nonnegative {\em integer} flows $b_{\ell}(e)$ and $b_{r}(e)$ to the left and right halves of the positive edge, starting at the left half-edge. Once we assign $b_{\ell}(e)$ units of flow, {\em we add $b_{\ell}(e)$ {\bf extra right positive half-edges}}  {\em incident to $j$}. Any right positive half-edge $e'$ is assigned a nonnegative integer flow $b_r(e')$ (whether it was an extra right positive half-edge, or an original one). When we assign a nonnegative integer flow to a right positive half-edge no edges of any kind are added making the process of adding extra edges to the graph finite.

where $a_i$ is the netflow at vertex $i$ and $\I_i(G)$, $\O^-_i(G)$, and $\O^+_i(G)$ are the incoming and outgoing to edges  as defined in Section~\ref{subsec:G_T}. We call these integer ${\bf a}$-flows {\bf dynamic}.",/home/shufan/que_tex/flowpolyJuly192012.tex,definition[],"

We assign nonnegative integer flows b_ℓ(e) and b_r(e) to the left and right halves of the positive edge, starting at the left half-edge.

Definitions for Parity Proof Framework,"We proceed with further definitions.  Suppose we have a label set that can be partitioned into pairs of \emph{opposite} labels.  We say such a label set is \emph{strictly symmetric} .  Define a \emph{labelling} $\ell$ to be an unordered, unoriented way of labelling a simplex, i.e.\ a multi-set of labels.  There is a natural notion of an \emph{opposite labelling} $-\ell$, where we take the opposite of each label in the multi-set.  We use \emph{$i$-labelling} to refer to the labelling of an $i$-simplex, i.e.\ a multi-set of $i+1$ labels.  Let $L^i$ denote the set of $i$-labellings.  Note that $L^i$ may not be strictly symmetric even though the label set is strictly symmetric, e.g.\ labelling $\{+e_1,-e_1\}$ is its own opposite.

Now we define the set of \emph{forbidden labellings} $F\subseteq\bigcup_{i=0}^n L^i$.  (Assume $F\cap L^0=\emptyset$; otherwise we would just make the label set smaller.)  In the case of Tucker's lemma, $F$ is the set of labellings with a complementary edge.  In the case of Theorem~\ref{thtucub}, $F$ is the set of labellings with a neutral simplex.  The idea is to choose $F$'s such that $L^i\backslash F$ is strictly symmetric for all $0\le i\le n$.  That is, $F$ must be symmetric and contain all the labellings which are their own opposite.

If $M^i$ is a strictly symmetric subset of $i$-labellings, then from each pair of opposite labellings, we can choose one to be the `+' labelling and the other to be the `-' labelling.  Let $M^i_+,M^i_-$ denote the set of $+,-$ labellings, respectively.  We call $M^i_+\cup M^i_-$ a \emph{partitioning} of $M^i$.

",Real tropical covers,"
 A 3-valent tropical cover π:C→ L together with a coloring of the edges of C in three colors (that in this paper we encode with dashed lines, bold lines or normal lines) is called real if the following conditions are satisfied:


  * 
No edges except wiener or fork edges can be bold.

  * An odd edge which is not part of balanced fork or wiener is normal.

  * The colors of the three adjacent edges of any vertex have to fit one of the following pictures, depending on the parity of the weight and the orientation of the adjacent edges as above, respectively the reflection of the pictures with the arrows turned around if two edges are incoming and one is outgoing.

Tropical real double Hurwitz numbers,"\label{def-realtrophurwitz}
Fix two partitions $\mu$ and $\nu$ of an integer $d\geq1$ and a genus $g$. Fix $0<r=2g-2+\ell(\mu)+\ell(\nu)$ points $p_1, \ldots, p_{r}$ in $\R\subset L$. 
The \textit{tropical real double Hurwitz number (with real structures)} $\tilde{H}_{g}^{\trop}(\mu,\nu)$ is defined as the weighted number $\tilde{H}_{g}^{\trop}(\mu,\nu)=\sum_{\pi} \tilde{m}(\pi)$ of tropical degree $d$ real covers $\pi: C \rightarrow L$ where
\begin{itemize}
 \item $C$ is an abstract tropical curve of genus $g$;
\item the tuple of weights of ends adjacent to leaves mapping to $-\infty$ is $\mu$, the tuple of weights of ends adjacent to leaves mapping to $\infty$ is $\nu$;
%\item the leaves are marked (to make those of the same weights distinguishable);
\item the preimage $\pi^{-1}(p_i)$ contains a vertex of $C$.
\end{itemize}
It follows from the Euler characteristic of $C$ together with the Riemann-Hurwitz formula that $C$ has only $3$-valent inner vertices, and that there are $r>0$ such vertices.

We now define the multiplicity $\tilde{m}(\pi)$ with which a real tropical cover $\pi:C\rightarrow L$ contributes to $\tilde{H}_{g}^{\trop}(\mu,\nu)$.
Assume $\pi$ has $W$ wieners, $B$ balanced forks, $E$ dashed or normal even bounded edges and $k$ bold wieners of weights $w_1,\ldots,w_k$. Then we define $$\tilde{m}(\pi):=\frac{1}{2^{W+B}}\cdot 2^{E}\cdot \prod_{i=1}^k w_i.$$

The  \textit{tropical real double Hurwitz number (without real structures)} $H_{g}^{\trop}(\mu,\nu)$ is defined analogously, we only change the multiplicity with which we count, i.e.\ we set $H_{g}^{\trop}(\mu,\nu)=\sum_{\pi} m(\pi)$. Here, $m(\pi)= \tilde{m}(\pi)$ except for the following two situations that we refer to as \emph{chains of wieners} . Chains of wieners can only appear if $\mu,\nu\in\{d,(\frac{d}{2},\frac{d}{2})\}$.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item If $d\equiv 2 \;\mod 4$ there is a chain of wieners with the following colors whose multiplicity $m(\pi)$ we define to be $0$:

We say that two such chains of wiener $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ have \emph{complementary colors} , if each wiener or balanced fork which is bold in $\Gamma_1$ is normal in $\Gamma_2$ and vice versa.
We define the sum of the multiplicities of a pair of chains of wieners in complementary colors to be
$$ m(\Gamma_1)+m(\Gamma_2):= \tilde{m}(\Gamma_1)+\tilde{m}(\Gamma_2)-2^{W-1},$$

Equivalently:

The Bijection for $\SOodd$,"We start with a pair $(Q,L)$ consisting of a standard Young tableau $Q$ in $\SYT(\lambda)$ and an orthogonal Littlewood-Richardson tableau $L$ in $\LRtabs$.

First we use Bijection $A$ (see Section~\ref{sec:BijA}) to change $L$ into an alternative orthogonal Littlewood-Richardson tableau $\tilde{L}$. Now we use $\tilde{L}$ to obtain a larger standard Young tableau $\tilde{Q}$ with row lengths of the same parity as follows. If $e$ is the largest entry in $Q$ we add a cells labeled $e+(\mu_{j+1}+\dots+\mu_{\ell(\mu)})+1$, $e+(\mu_{j+1}+\dots+\mu_{\ell(\mu)})+2$,  $\dots$, $e+(\mu_{j+1}+\dots+\mu_{\ell(\mu)})+\mu_j$ to the spots where cells labeled $j$ are in $\tilde{L}$, such that the numbers in the horizontal strip belonging to $j$ are increasing from left to right. We obtain a new standard Young tableau $\tilde{Q}$ with the same shape as $L$. Moreover the $\mu$ largest entries form a $\mu$-horizontal strip (see Section~\ref{sec:BijB}).

Now we distinguish two cases: If our resulting tableau $\tilde{Q}$ consists of even length rows this is the tableau we will use in Bijection $B$ (see Section~\ref{sec:BijB}). Otherwise, thus when $\tilde{Q}$ consists of $n$ odd length rows, we concatenate the one column tableau filled with $1,2,\dots,n$ from left to $\tilde{Q}$. We obtain an all even rowed standard Young tableau, which we will use in in Bijection $B$.

We continue applying Bijection $B$ to $\tilde{Q}$ and obtain a vacillating tableau $\tilde{V}$ with shape $\emptyset$ and cut-away-shape $\mu$ (shape $\emptyset$ ending with $\mu_{\ell(\mu)}$ $(-\ell(\mu))$'s, $\dots$, $\mu_2$ $(-2)$'s and $\mu_1$ $(-1)$'s, see Section~\ref{sec:BijB}).

Once again we distinguish the two cases from before. If we did not concatenate with a column, we do not change $\tilde{V}$. If we concatenated a column to $\tilde{Q}$, we delete the first $n$ entries of $\tilde{V}$. In this case those always are $1,2,\dots,k,0,-k,\dots,-2,-1$. 
Therefore we obtain once again a vacillating tableau $\tilde{V}$ with shape $\emptyset$ and cut-away-shape $\mu$.

We finish our algorithm by deleting the last $|\mu|=\mu_1+\mu_2+\dots+\mu_k$ entries to obtain a vacillating tableau $V$ of shape $\mu$ and length $r=|\lambda|$.",/home/shufan/que_tex/1902.03843.tex,definition[],"We start with a pair (Q,L) consisting of a standard Young tableau Q in (λ) and an orthogonal Littlewood-Richardson tableau L in .

We have either $\mathcal{E}_i-1=\mathcal{C}_i$ or
$\mathcal{E}_i-2=\mathcal{C}_i$: in the first case, the edge dual to $\tau_i$ in the tropical curve leads to a fixed component, in the second to a free component (see definition \ref{definition:fixed_free_components}).

Moreover, $C_\mathcal{S}$ passes through the points $p_1,\dots,p_n$ by construction \ref{construction:dual_tropical_curve}.

Convention on basepoints,"\label{def:subdn basepoints}
Suppose $Y\subseteq \Z^n$ is a based digital image with basepoint $y_0 = (y_1, \ldots, y_n)$.  In any subdivision $S(Y, k)$ of $Y$ we may take $\overline{y_0} \in  S(y_0, k)\subseteq S(Y, k)$ as the basepoint, where $\overline{y_0}$ denotes the point whose coordinates are
%
$$\overline{y_0}= \begin{cases} (2ky_1 + k-1, \ldots, 2ky_n + k-1) & \text{ in } S(Y, 2k)\\ \big( (2k+1)y_1 + k, \ldots, (2k+1)y_n + k\big) & \text{ in } S(Y, 2k+1).\end{cases}$$
%
In an odd subdivision, $\overline{y_0}$ is the centre point of $S(y_0, 2k+1)$, which is a cubical  lattice in $\Z^n$, each side of which contains $2k+1$ points.  In an even subdivision, $S(y_0, 2k)$ does not have a centre point, as such, since there is no middle point in an interval which contains $2k$ points.  Rather, $\overline{y_0}$ is a corner of the \emph{central clique} of  $S(y_0, 2k)$, which is to say a unit cubical  lattice in $\Z^n$ that may be considered as the center of $S(y_0, 2k)$.  Usually, and unless there is some reason not to do so, we will choose  $\overline{y_0}$ as the basepoint of a subdivision $S(Y, k)$.   One exception to this is  our convention that $0 \in I_N$ is the basepoint of an interval. This means that when we  subdivide an interval, the basepoint of $S(I_N, k) = I_{Nk+k-1}$ will be $0$ rather than $\overline{0} = k$.   However we choose the basepoint in a subdivision, so long as we have the basepoint of $S(Y, k)$ to be some point in $S(y_0, k) \subseteq S(Y, k)$, then the standard projection $\rho_k \colon S(Y, k) \to Y$ is a based map.  In particular, note  that we have $\rho_k(\overline{y_0}) = y_0$.   Furthermore, with our convention that $\overline{y_0}$ is the basepoint of $S(Y, k)$, the partial projections $\rho^c_k\colon S(Y, k) \to S(Y, k-1)$ for each $k \geq 3$ of \defref{def: rho^c} are also based maps.  Indeed, from the formulas of \defref{def: rho^c}, for
$\rho^c_{2k+1}\colon S(Y, 2k+1) \to S(Y, 2k)$, with $k\geq 1$,  we have
%
$$\begin{aligned}
\rho^c_{2k+1}(\overline{y_0}) &= \rho^c_{2k+1}\big( (2k+1)y_1 + k, \ldots, (2k+1)y_n + k \big)  \\
&= (2ky_1 + k-1, \ldots, 2ky_n + k-1) = \overline{y_0} \in S(Y, 2k).\end{aligned}$$
%
On the other hand, for
$\rho^c_{2k}\colon S(Y, 2k) \to S(Y, 2k-1)$, with $k\geq 2$,  we have
%

Nonstandard concepts,"\label{nonst}  Let $G$ be a nonstandard additive group, and let $A, B$ be nonstandard finite subsets of $G$.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] We say that $A$ is \emph{small} if its cardinality $|A|$ is a standard natural number, and \emph{large} otherwise.  (Note that $A$ is small if and only if it is (externally) finite.)  We say that $A,B$ have \emph{comparable size} if $|A| \ll |B| \ll |A|$.
\item[(ii)]  We say that $A$ is \emph{somewhat sum-closed} if $\phi(A)$ is (standardly) finite. 
\item[(iii)] We write
$$ A+B := \{ a+b: a \in A, b \in B \}$$ 
for the Minkowski sum of $A$ and $B$, and say that $A$ has \emph{bounded doubling} if $|A+A| \ll |A|$.  For instance, any coset $x+H$ of a nonstandard finite group $H$ is of bounded doubling.
\item[(iv)] For any standard natural number $l$, we write $lA = A + \dots + A$ for the $l$-fold iterated sumset of $A$.  (
Although it can be done, we will not need to define $lA$ for unbounded $l$.)
\item[(v)] We say that $A$ \emph{avoids} $B$ if $|A \cap B| = o(|B|)$, and \emph{occupies} $B$ if it does not avoid $B$ (or equivalently, if $|A \cap B| \gg |B|$).  For instance, if $A$ and $B$ are groups, $A$ avoids $B$ when $A \cap B$ has (externally) infinite index in $B$, and $A$ occupies $B$ when $A \cap B$ has (externally) finite index in $B$.  See also Figure \ref{fig:com}.
\item[(vi)]  We say that $A$ and $B$ are \emph{commensurate} if they occupy each other, and \emph{transverse} if they avoid each other.  
\item[(vii)] A sequence $A_n$ of sets indexed by standard natural numbers $n$ is said to be an \emph{wandering sequence} if for every standard natural numbers $n,m$, we have $(A_n+A_m) \cap (A_n+A_{m'}) = \emptyset$ for all but finitely many $m'$.  For instance, if $x_n+H$ is a sequence of disjoint cosets of a single nonstandard finite group $H$, then the $x_n+H$ form an wandering sequence.
\item[(viii)] We say that $A$ has the \emph{wandering property} if the sequence $nA$ is an wandering sequence, or equivalently that $nA \cap n'A = \emptyset$ whenever $n'$ is sufficiently large depending on $n$.  For example, a coset $x+H$ of a nonstandard finite group $H$ has the wandering property if and only if $x$ has infinite order in $G/H$, or equivalently if $nx \not \in H$ for any standard $n$.  As another example, if $G = {}^* \Z$ are the nonstandard integers and $N$ is an unbounded natural number, then the nonstandard interval $\{ n \in {}^* \Z: N \leq n < 2N \}$ has the wandering property, but the nonstandard interval $\{ n \in {}^* \Z: 1 \leq n \leq N\}$ does not.

linear tree;linear path;linear cycle;skeleton," [skeleton]
%A \emph{linear tree} is a hypergraph obtained from a single hyperedge by repeatedly adding other hyperedges that intersect the previous hypergraph in exactly one vertex. A \emph{linear path} is a linear tree built so that the next hyperedge always intersects the previous hyperedge in a vertex of degree one. A \emph{linear cycle} is obtained from a linear path of at least two edges, by adding an edge that intersects the first and the last edges of the linear path in one of their degree one vertices. A \emph{skeleton} $T$ in $H$ is a linear subtree of $H$ which cannot be extended to a larger linear subtree by adding a hyperedge $e$ of $H$ for which $\abs{e \cap V(T)} = 1$.

Algebraic varieties,"Let $n$ be a natural number, and let $k$ be an algebraically closed field.  An \emph{affine variety} (or more precisely, an \emph{algebraic set} ) in $k^n$ over $k$ is a set $V$ of the form
\begin{equation}\label{vdef}
V =\{ x \in k^n\mid P_1(x) = \ldots = P_m(x) = 0 \}
\end{equation}
for some polynomials $P_1,\ldots,P_m: k^n \to k$.    Similarly, we define the \emph{projective space} $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$ to be the space of equivalence classes $[x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1}]$ of tuples $(x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1}) \in k^{n+1} \backslash \{0\}$ after quotienting out by dilations by $k$, and define a \emph{projective variety} in $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$ to be a set $V$ of the form
\begin{equation}\label{vdef-2}
V =\{ x \in \mathbb{P}^n(k)\mid P_1(x) = \ldots = P_m(x) = 0 \}
\end{equation}
for some homogeneous polynomials $P_1,\ldots,P_m: k^{n+1} \to k$ (note that the constraint $P_1(x)=\ldots=P_m(x)=0$ is well-defined in $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$).   We embed $k^n$ in $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$ in the usual manner, identifying $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ with $[x_1,\ldots,x_n,1]$; thus for instance every affine variety can be viewed as a subset of an associated projective variety.  

A subset of $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$ is said to be a \emph{quasiprojective variety} if it is the set-theoretic difference of two projective varieties in $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$.  Thus for instance the set-theoretic difference of two affine varieties in $k^n$ is a quasiprojective variety.  
A \emph{constructible set} in $k^n$ is a boolean combination of finitely many affine varieties in $k^n$.  As noted in Section \ref{algreg-sec}, constructible sets are definable over $k$ (indeed, as $k$ is algebraically closed, the two concepts coincide in this setting), and so we can inherit the notion of complexity for such sets.  

We define the \emph{Zariski topology} on $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$ by declaring the projective varieties to be the closed sets; thus, for instance, the \emph{Zariski closure} $\overline{E}$ of a subset $E$ of $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$ is the intersection of all the projective varieties which contain that set.  One can then induce the Zariski topologies on other varieties by restriction.  For instance, in the affine space $k^n$, the Zariski closed sets are given by the affine varieties.

An affine (resp. projective) variety is \emph{geometrically irreducible} , or \emph{irreducible} for short, if it is non-empty and cannot be expressed as the union of two strictly smaller affine (resp. projective) varieties.  We say that a quasiprojective variety (or more generally, a constructible set) is irreducible if its Zariski closure is irreducible.  It is well known (see e.g. \cite[Propositions I.5.2, I.5.3]{mumf}) that any affine (resp. projective) variety can be uniquely decomposed into finitely many irreducible subvarieties, no two of which are contained in each other.  

The \emph{dimension} $\dim(V)$ of a non-empty affine (resp. projective) variety $V$ is the largest natural number $d$ for which there is a chain 
$$ \emptyset \neq V_0 \subsetneq V_1 \subsetneq \ldots \subsetneq V_d \subset V$$
of irreducible affine (resp. projective)  varieties $V_0, \ldots, V_d$; this is always a finite natural number.  We adopt the convention that the empty set has dimension $-\infty$.  The dimension of a quasiprojective variety (in $k^n$ or $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$) is defined to be the dimension of its Zariski closure in the indicated ambient space.  A variety will be called a \emph{curve} if it has dimension one.

If $V,W$ are two varieties with $V \subseteq W$, we say that $V$ is a \emph{subvariety} of $W$.  If $V \subsetneq W$, we say that $V$ is a \emph{strict subvariety} of $W$.

Let $\F$ be a subfield of $k$.  We say that an affine (resp. projective) variety is \emph{defined over $\F$} if one can find polynomials $P_1,\ldots,P_m$ with coefficients in $\F$ for which \eqref{vdef} (resp. \eqref{vdef-2}) holds.  A quasiprojective variety is defined over $\F$ if it is the set-theoretic difference of two affine varieties defined over $\F$.  If $V \subset k^n$ is a quasiprojective variety, we define $V(\F) := V \cap \F^n$ to be the $F$-points of $V$; note that this is a definable subset over $\F$.

Let $V$ be a quasiprojective variety.  If $V \subset k^n$, a \emph{regular function} on $V$ is a function $f: V \to k$ which, at every point $p$ in $V$, agrees with a rational function from (an open dense subset of) $k^n$ to $k$ on an open neighbourhood of $p$ in $V$.  If instead $V \subset \mathbb{P}^n(k)$, a regular function on $V$ is a function which is regular when restricted to the $n+1$ affine subsets $\{ [x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1}] \in \mathbb{P}^n(k)\mid x_i \neq 0 \}$, $i=1,\ldots,n+1$ that cover ${\mathbb P}^n(k)$, each of which can be identified with the affine space $k^n$ in the obvious manner.  The ring of regular functions on $V$ is denoted $k[V]$, and its fraction field (which is well defined for irreducible $V$) is denoted $k(V)$.  A map $\phi: V \to W$ between two quasiprojective varieties is a \emph{regular morphism} if every regular function on $W$ pulls back by $\phi$ to a regular function on $V$.  A \emph{regular isomorphism} is an invertible regular morphism whose inverse is also regular.",/home/shufan/que_tex/1211.2894.tex,definition[],"Let n be a natural number, and let k be an algebraically closed field.

for some homogeneous polynomials P_1,…,P_m: k^n+1→ k (note that the constraint P_1(x)=…=P_m(x)=0 is well-defined in ℙ^n(k)).   We embed k^n in ℙ^n(k) in the usual manner, identifying (x_1,…,x_n) with [x_1,…,x_n,1]; thus for instance every affine variety can be viewed as a subset of an associated projective variety.  

A subset of ℙ^n(k) is said to be a quasiprojective variety if it is the set-theoretic difference of two projective varieties in ℙ^n(k).  Thus for instance the set-theoretic difference of two affine varieties in k^n is a quasiprojective variety.  
A constructible set in k^n is a boolean combination of finitely many affine varieties in k^n.  As noted in Section <ref>, constructible sets are definable over k (indeed, as k is algebraically closed, the two concepts coincide in this setting), and so we can inherit the notion of complexity for such sets.  

We define the Zariski topology on ℙ^n(k) by declaring the projective varieties to be the closed sets; thus, for instance, the Zariski closure E of a subset E of ℙ^n(k) is the intersection of all the projective varieties which contain that set.  One can then induce the Zariski topologies on other varieties by restriction.  For instance, in the affine space k^n, the Zariski closed sets are given by the affine varieties.

An affine (resp. projective) variety is geometrically irreducible , or irreducible for short, if it is non-empty and cannot be expressed as the union of two strictly smaller affine (resp. projective) varieties.  We say that a quasiprojective variety (or more generally, a constructible set) is irreducible if its Zariski closure is irreducible.  It is well known (see e.g. <cit.>) that any affine (resp. projective) variety can be uniquely decomposed into finitely many irreducible subvarieties, no two of which are contained in each other.  

The dimension (V) of a non-empty affine (resp. projective) variety V is the largest natural number d for which there is a chain 

    ∅≠ V_0 ⊊ V_1 ⊊…⊊ V_d ⊂ V

of irreducible affine (resp. projective)  varieties V_0, …, V_d; this is always a finite natural number.  We adopt the convention that the empty set has dimension -∞.  The dimension of a quasiprojective variety (in k^n or ℙ^n(k)) is defined to be the dimension of its Zariski closure in the indicated ambient space.  A variety will be called a curve if it has dimension one.

If V,W are two varieties with V ⊆ W, we say that V is a subvariety of W.  If V ⊊ W, we say that V is a strict subvariety of W.

Let  be a subfield of k.  We say that an affine (resp. projective) variety is defined over  if one can find polynomials P_1,…,P_m with coefficients in  for which (<ref>) (resp. (<ref>)) holds.  A quasiprojective variety is defined over  if it is the set-theoretic difference of two affine varieties defined over .  If V ⊂ k^n is a quasiprojective variety, we define V() := V ∩^n to be the F-points of V; note that this is a definable subset over .

Let V be a quasiprojective variety.  If V ⊂ k^n, a regular function on V is a function f: V → k which, at every point p in V, agrees with a rational function from (an open dense subset of) k^n to k on an open neighbourhood of p in V.  If instead V ⊂ℙ^n(k), a regular function on V is a function which is regular when restricted to the n+1 affine subsets { [x_1,…,x_n+1] ∈ℙ^n(k)| x_i ≠ 0 }, i=1,…,n+1 that cover ℙ^n(k), each of which can be identified with the affine space k^n in the obvious manner.  The ring of regular functions on V is denoted k[V], and its fraction field (which is well defined for irreducible V) is denoted k(V).  A map ϕ: V → W between two quasiprojective varieties is a regular morphism if every regular function on W pulls back by ϕ to a regular function on V.  A regular isomorphism is an invertible regular morphism whose inverse is also regular."
Nonstandard objects and functions,"Given a sequence $(x_\n)_{\n \in \N}$ of standard objects in ${\mathfrak U}$, we define their \emph{ultralimit} $\lim_{\n \to \alpha} x_\n$ to be the equivalence class of all sequences $(y_\n)_{\n \in \N}$ of standard objects in ${\mathfrak U}$ such that $x_\n = y_\n$ for $\n$ sufficiently close to $\alpha$.

(More precisely, perform row operations on $A_1$ so that $A_1[X, \{y\}]$ is a unit column with $(A_1)_{x,y}=1$. Then replace every element $\delta\in\Delta$ with the row vector $-\delta_y A_1[\{x\}, Y_0\cup Y_1\cup C]+\delta$.

%Let $G$ be a hypergraph with vertices $V=\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ and edges
%$E$, and let $s$ be a positive integer. We create a new hypergraph
%$G^s$, called \emph{the $s^{\text{th}}$ expansion of $G$}. We form the vertex set of $G^s$ by replacing each $x_i$ with vertices $x_{i,1}, \dots$, $x_{i,s}$, and we call each of these vertices \emph{shadows} of $x_i$. In analogy with the algebraic process of polarization, we call setting each $x_{i,t}$ equal to $x_i$ \emph{depolarization} . The edge set of $G^s$ consists of two types of edges. First, we connect each pair of shadows of the same variable, so we have edges $x_{i,j}x_{i,\ell}$ for all $1 \le j < \ell \le s$. Second, for each edge $x_{i_{1}}\cdots x_{i_{r}}$ of $G$, we have $s^r$ edges $x_{i_1,j_1}\cdots x_{i_r,j_r}$ of $G^s$, where $1 \le j_t \le s$ for each $t$.

We define the transfer matrix T() as the square matrix whose rows
and columns are indexed by the vertices in  such that
T_,()=^|| if there is an arc from
 to , and T_,()=0  otherwise.
We say that ^|| is the weight of an arc (,).
The weight of a directed walk in D is defined to be the product of the
weights of the arcs of the walk.
The start vector () is defined as the row vector whose
jth entry is the weight of the arc from _s to the
jth recurrent vertex (this entry is zero if such an arc
does not exist).
For each integer 0≤ b<, we define the finish vector
_b() as the column vector whose jth entry is the
sum of weights of all arcs from the jth recurrent vertex
to a vertex in _b(G)."

Rotation maps,"\label{def:rotation_map}
The rotation
$$\tausqc: [m] \longrightarrow [m]$$
is the map on the positions in the word $\Qc$ defined as follows. If $q_i=s$, then $\tausqc(i)$ is defined as the position in $\Qc$ of the next occurrence of $s$ if possible, and as the first occurrence of $\wo s \wo$ otherwise.

Using the bijection $\posToRootsc$ from the positions in the word $\Qc$ to almost positive roots, this rotation can also be regarded as a map from almost positive roots to almost positive roots. For simplicity, we abuse of notation and also write
$$\tauc: \Phi_{\geq-1} \longrightarrow \Phi_{\geq-1}$$
for the composition $\posToRootsc  \circ  \tausqc  \circ  \posToRootsc^{-1}$. This composition can be expressed purely in terms of roots as 
$$ 
\tauc (\alpha) =
\begin{cases}
	c_1\cdots c_{i-1} ( \alpha_{c_i}) &\text{ if } \alpha = -\alpha_{c_i}, \\
	-\alpha_{c_i} &\text{ if } \alpha = c_n\cdots c_{i+1} (\alpha_{c_i}), \\
	c (\alpha) &\text{ otherwise.} \\
\end{cases}
$$

\noindent
The first and the third lines of this equation are given by the root corresponding to the next occurrence of the letter associated to $\alpha$ in $\Qc$. The second line corresponds to the case when the letter associated to $\alpha$ in $\Qc$ is the last occurrence of this letter in $\Qc$. This case can be easily explained as follows. Let~$\eta :S\rightarrow S$ be the involution~$\eta(s)=\wo s \wo$. 
The last occurrence of $\eta(c_i)$ in $\Qc$ is the position which is mapped under $\tauc$ to the first occurrence of $c_i$ in $\Qc$. In other words, if we denote by $\alpha$ the root associated to the last occurrence of $\eta(c_i)$ in $\Qc$, then $\tauc(\alpha)=-\alpha_{c_i}$. In addition, the word $\woc$ is, up to commutations, equal to a word with suffix $(\eta(c_1),\dots,\eta(c_n))$~\cite[Proposition~7.1]{CeballosLabbeStump}. From this we conclude that~$\alpha=c_n\cdots c_{i+1} (\alpha_{c_i})$ as desired.
%\[\alpha=(\wo \eta(c_n)\cdots \eta(c_{i+1}))(\wo(\alpha_{c_i}))=c_n\cdots c_{i+1} (\alpha_{c_i})\] 

Using the bijection $\posToVarc$ from the positions in the word $\Qc$ to cluster variables, the rotation can also be regarded as a map on the set of cluster variables. Again for simplicity, we also write
$$\tau: \{\text{cluster variables of } \cA(W)\} \longrightarrow \{\text{cluster variables of } \cA(W)\}$$
for the composition~$\posToVarc \circ \tausqc \circ \posToVarc^{-1}$. This composition can be expressed purely in terms of cluster variables as follows. Consider the cluster variables expressed in terms of the initial cluster seed~$X_c$ associated to the weighted quiver~$\weightedQuiverc$ (recall that this quiver is by definition the Coxeter graph of the Coxeter system~$(W,S)$ directed according to the order of appearance of the simple reflections in~$c$). If~$y$ is the cluster variable at vertex~$i$ of a quiver obtained from~$\weightedQuiverc$ after a sequence of mutations~$\mu_{i_1}\rightarrow \dots \rightarrow \mu_{i_r}$, then the rotation~$\tau(y)$ is the cluster variable at vertex~$i$ of the quiver obtained from~$\weightedQuiverc$ after the sequence of mutations~$\mu_{c_1}\rightarrow \dots \rightarrow \mu_{c_n} \rightarrow \mu_{i_1}\rightarrow \dots \rightarrow \mu_{i_r}$.

Now if T_0=(G_0,C_0,L_0) is a canvas, then we extend all the above terminology to T_0
in the natural way. 
Thus we can speak of tripods or quadpods of T_0, we define T_0X:=T_0[G_0X], etc.

Recall the definition of the quantum numbers [n]_y=y^n/2-y^-n/2/y^1/2-y^-1/2.
Let  L be a line bundle on S and let α, β be sequences with Iα+Iβ=HL, and 
let δ≥ 0 be an integer. We define the refined relative Severi degrees N^(S,L),δ(α,β)(y) 
recursively as follows: if γ(L, β,δ)>0, then 

    N^(S,L),δ(α,β)(y)   =∑_k:β_k>0 [k]_y ·  N^(S,L),δ(α+e_k,β-e_k)(y)

Here the second sum runs through all  α',β',δ' satisfying the condition

    α'   ≤α,  β'≥β, Iα'+Iβ'=H(L-H),
    δ'   =δ+g(L-H)-g(L)+|β'-β|+1=δ-H(L-H)+|β'-β|.
